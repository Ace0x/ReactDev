known himself  goneril  the best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then must we look to receive from his age not alone the imperfections of longengraffed condition but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them  regan  such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kents banishment  goneril  there is further compliment of leavetaking
